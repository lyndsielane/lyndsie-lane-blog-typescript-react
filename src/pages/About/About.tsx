        Hello, I'm Lyndsie Lane, a Christian, wife, and mother with a passion
        for the written word. I am a full time business analyst and write in my
        spare time, when I find some. I am a chronic pain warrior with
        Fibromyalgia, Arthritis, Degenerative Disc Disease, and IBS. I'm also a
        mental health warrior dealing with Bipolar 1, PTSD, and generalized and
        social anxiety.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently working on writing my story of trauma, love, loss, grief,
        and so many things in between it all. The blurb is below, I hope to
        publish it by the end of 2024. Enjoy.

        Can hope survive in the midst of unimaginable tragedy?<br></br>
        Losing a child is every parentsâ€™ worst nightmare. Yet that brutal
        reality is exactly what Lyndsie Lane was forced to endure. <br></br>
        After watching her young daughter lose her battle with Cystic Fibrosis,
        Lyndsie hunted for hope in her darkest hour. That was when she learned a
        lesson that has carried her through every day since. Turning to the
        light in hard times is a choice, and not an easy one. But survival
        depends on it.<br></br>
        Lyndsie's faith was tested time and again. Still, it was the fire of the
        Holy Spirit within her that led Lyndsie through the darkness of despair.
        <br></br>
        Join Lyndsie as she shares her story. One of unlikely heroes, overcoming
        challenges, and a special type of magic called hope.{" "}
