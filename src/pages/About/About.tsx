        Hello, I'm Lyndsie Lane, a Christian, wife, and mother with a passion
        for the written word. I am a full-time business analyst and write in my
        spare time when I find some. I am a chronic pain warrior with
        Fibromyalgia, Arthritis, Degenerative Disc Disease, and IBS. I'm also a
        mental health warrior dealing with Bipolar 1, PTSD, and generalized and
        social anxiety.
      </p> 
      <p>
        Lyndsie Lane is a Christian girl who loves to keep her head in the clouds while 
        attempting to keep her feet on the ground. She has severe addictions to coffee, tea, 
        reading, writing, and Autumn and is completely awe-stricken with dragonflies.<br></br> 
        She spends her days chasing around two crazy kids, three rambunctious dogs, and a house 
        dragon while attempting to fit as much reading and writing as she can into the hectic mom life.
        <br></br>Lyndsie hopes her writing illuminates hope for all her readers as she looks for 
        the silver lining in all of life.
