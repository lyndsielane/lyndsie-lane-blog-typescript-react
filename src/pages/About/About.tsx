        Hello, I'm Lyndsie Lane, a Christian, wife, and mother. I am a full-time
        business analyst and Web Developer by design. After spending 11 years in
        the Customer Service industry, I stepped into the Technical world,
        bringing a customer-first approach to my web design abilities. I have a
        heart for adding accessibility into all sites.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not working or designing, I'm a simple Christian girl who keeps
        her head in the clouds while attempting to keep her feet on the ground.
        I have severe addictions to coffee, tea, reading, and Autumn and am
        completely awe-stricken with dragonflies.<br></br>I spend my days
        chasing around two crazy kids, three rambunctious dogs, and a house
        dragon while attempting to fit as much reading and relaxing as I can
        into the hectic mom life.
      </p>
