        Hello, I'm Lyndsie Lane, a full-stack developer with a passion for
        front-end and the user experience. I have a background in customer
        service and management. I have implemented new services and trained
        employees while streamlining new business practices. I am well versed in
        deescalation and ensuring customers are cared for throughout any
        processes involved in fulfilling their needs. My experience has given me
        detailed views of business from the customer, employee, and business
        standpoint.

        After studying coding at Georgia Tech, I am moving into a coding career

        path. My creativity, dedication, and hard work combined with bountiful
        experience make me a great fit for any application or website
